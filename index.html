                <li>Binary Defense is the global leader in attack intelligence and advanced managed security solutions. Our motto “Defend. Protect. Secure.“​ drives our company to continue to be better and help you defend your company via an Intelligent Security Operations Center (iSOC). Binary Defense was spawned from the need for better monitoring and detection capabilities in companies. The founder of Binary Defense, David Kennedy, also founded TrustedSec which specializes in information security services including penetration testing. The cutting edge, white hat hackers noticed almost every organization with monitoring capabilities really struggled, especially when using an MSSP. Countless attacks went undetected, and breaches were missed which left companies wondering what to do. As a result, Binary Defense was first put into motion in July of 2012 with the development of our Managed Detection, Deception and Response software (Binary Defense Vision) based on profiling how attackers think. A number of years of development, marrying up attack intelligence with our extensive threat intelligence, has made our product the best consolidation of technologies in the industry to predict, prevent, detect, deceive and respond to attacks.</li>

                <li>Deep Instinct is the first company to apply deep learning to cybersecurity. Deep learning is inspired by the brain’s ability to learn. Once a brain learns to identify an object, its identification becomes second nature. Similarly, as Deep Instinct’s artificial deep neural network brain learns to prevent any type of cyber threat, its prediction capabilities become instinctive. As a result, any kind of malware, known and new, first-seen malware, zero-days, ransomware and APT attacks from any kind are predicted and prevented in zero-time with unmatched accuracy and speed anywhere in the enterprise – Endpoint, Network, Mobile – enabling a multi layered protection.</li>
